A website to sell software of unuses licence,easily.

Creating the SoftSell marketing website using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript was a comprehensive and insightful process that combined both frontend design and interactive functionality. I started by structuring the core layout with semantic HTML, ensuring that each section—such as the hero, "How It Works," "Why Choose Us," testimonials, and contact form—was clearly defined for a smooth user flow.

For styling, I utilized Tailwind CSS due to its utility-first approach, which allowed me to quickly build a responsive and visually appealing interface without writing extensive custom CSS. This included applying modern design principles like gradients, shadows, and flexible grid layouts to ensure the site looked great on both mobile and desktop devices. Where needed, custom CSS complemented Tailwind for finer adjustments.

However, I also integrated custom CSS for additional polish. For example, I used CSS to:

Customize  dark and light mode button  .
to build a dark/light mode toggle.

To enhance user interaction, I implemented key features using JavaScript. These included a dark/light mode toggle that adds or removes the dark class on the <html> element while saving the user's preference in localStorage for persistence across sessions. Additionally, I added basic frontend form validation for the contact form to provide feedback when submitted.

Throughout the project, I focused on maintaining clean, readable code while optimizing performance and accessibility. This experience helped me strengthen my understanding of responsive design, DOM manipulation, and state management with JavaScript, as well as integrating Tailwind CSS effectively for rapid development. The end result is a functional, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing single-page application that meets the project’s requirements.
